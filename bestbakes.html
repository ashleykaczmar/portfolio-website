          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <br>
          <p>As part of the CareerFoundry UI Design Course, I created Best Bakes; a responsive web app that follows a mobile-first approach.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>What is Best Bakes?</h3>
          <p>Best Bakes is a responsive web app that offers easy to understand recipes and resources for new and experienced bakers. This detailed case study showcases the research, analysis, ideation and testing that allowed me to design a responsive web app centered on user needs.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Baking is tricky for many because it requires a certain level of precision and understanding of food chemistry to get that perfect bake. This can make it intimidating for beginner bakers and turn them off trying it altogether.</p> 
          <br>
          <h3>The Idea</h3>
          <br>
          <p>The goal of the app is to teach the basics of baking and provide recipes at various difficulty levels so that users grow more comfortable with baking. I wanted this app to be extremely user-friendly; easy to navigate between recipes and educational resources.</p>
